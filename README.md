## About

This repository is part of my frontend learning journey. It contains hands-on HTML and CSS examples that focus on layout building, styling, responsiveness, and understanding how modern web pages are structured visually.

The goal is not just to write code, but to **understand how real-world UIs are built from scratch using pure HTML and CSS**.

The repository consists of multiple folders/files, each representing a specific concept, layout, or UI experiment.

### Professional Advice (as your mentor)

This repo is **good**, but to make it **resume-ready**:

1. Add **2–3 complete mini projects** (landing page, portfolio, dashboard UI).
2. Add **screenshots** in the README.
3. Create **one folder = one project**, each with its own `README.md`.
4. Mention **responsive support** explicitly.

If you want, next I can:
- Refactor this README to **resume-optimized**
- Design **one flagship HTML-CSS project** for this repo
- Review and restructure folders like an industry codebase
